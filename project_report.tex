\title{Report. Contemporary Software Development project. Developing a housing parser}

\begin{abstract}
This report is devoted to housing parsing tool. It describes first iteration of the tool, which is able to parse housing portals in Uppsala and present them via Telegram bot.
Tool is developed in Python 3. MySQL 8 database is used for data storage. 
Code is covered with unit and integration tests. Code coverage is measured with coverage tool for Python.
Git is used as version control system. Link to the github repository is \url{https://github.com/mboronin/housing_bot}.

I have selected this project, since I do not have a lot of experience in parsing web parsing and bot creating, therefore I considered it as a good idea to get a hands-on experience in development of such tools.

\section{Design}
To develop a design for this software project, I have decided to inspect the code of the most famous portal: \url{bostad.uppsala.se}. I have noticed, that code contains a lot of <span> tags on the page with available housing. Those tags contain all object information, so there is no need to open and parse a page related to one specific apartment.


\section{Development}
I have tried working with lxml, which is a quite popular library for Python web-parsing.
However, after reading some articles, I have realised, that BeatifulSoup is a better and modern approach. It is a framework, which includes lxml inside of it, however it also contains additional features, which made it easier to implement the bot. It also makes the solution more scalable.
So, I began with the link \url{https://gist.github.com/yosemitebandit/1805918}, where basic Beautiful Soup template is introduced

Time issue

There was an issue with ids, since the ids provided are higher than int size
I have realized that adress cannot be used as a unique key in a database
